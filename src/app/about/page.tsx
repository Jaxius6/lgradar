              Born from the frustration of manual compliance tracking, LG Radar was created by 
              local government professionals who knew there had to be a better way.

                <p>
                  LG Radar was founded in 2023 by a team of local government compliance officers 
                  and software engineers who experienced firsthand the challenges of staying on 
                  top of WA Government Gazettes and regulatory changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After countless late nights manually checking gazettes and nearly missing 
                  critical disallowance deadlines, we knew councils deserved better. We built 
                  LG Radar to be the compliance radar every council needsâ€”automated, intelligent, 
                  and always watching.
                </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Our Mission</h3>
              <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
                <p>
                  To eliminate compliance anxiety for local government professionals by providing 
                  intelligent, automated monitoring of regulatory changes and deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that compliance should be proactive, not reactive. Our technology 
                  ensures that councils never miss a critical deadline or regulatory change, 
                  giving them the confidence to focus on strategic initiatives.
